Thank you for your interest in our internship opening. As a next step, we are expecting you to complete a short assignment.

1. Create a flutter app where users would be able to a see a welcome screen.
2. On clicking next the user should be shown a Sign in screen.
3. If he skips the process he should be shown a guest screen.
4. If the user is an authenticated user he should be shown his profile.[Profile section must have Full Name, Email, Address Details]
5. Home Page must have 2 tab section -> Personal Details, Location
6. User should be able to edit the personal details of the user
5. On Location Tab, render the map to showcase real time location of the user. [Get Developer Access to either Here/Google Maps API] ----> done
6. On clicking any location on the map the user should be able to add a marker on the map. 
7. On top of the marker user should be able to see the address of that location.

Preference would be given if the back end implementation is done using node js & MongoDB
